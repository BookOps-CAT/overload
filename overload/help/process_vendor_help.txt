Process Vendor File (PVF) is a tool for preprocessing MARC records received from
vendors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PVF jobs:
- preprocess NYPL & BPL MARC files
- validate MARC records to adhere to MARC21 rules
- validate vendor records against specification set for each vendor
- display & record errors for statistical purposes
- join multiple MARC files into as few files as possible (in most cases PVF will
    create two files: new and duplicate records)
- add constant data to certain vendor files
- add bib numbers to vendor records that already are present in the database
- split records into two separate files: NEW (new records) and DUP (duplicate 
    records) so they can be loaded into Sierra using the most appropriate load
    table
- move processed vendor records into archive folder
- display statistical information for the user of processed records during the
    session

PVF procedure:
1. Select target database and it's accesing method
2. Select MARC file(s) for processing (click, drag, use ctrl/shift to select
    multiple files)
3. Select validation to be performed (optional)
4. Click Process
    a) PVF will first attempt to validate records in MARCEdit if selected
        unsucessful validation will result in termination of processing ;
        please fix the records or unselect validation to continue ; PVF will
        display the result of the validation in the pop-up window
    b) PVF will determine vendor and type of records
    c) PVF will attempt to validate records agains local rules specified
        results of the validation will be displayed in a pop-up window
    d) next, PVE will query database if needed to determine if the library
        already has record for the material (conditional)
    e) PVE will add bib numbers to duplicate records if applicable
    f) PVE will add constant data if applicable
    g) PVE will save records into NEW or DUP files based on results of the
        above database query
5. Confirm error report
    a) see details of validation reports;
    b) commit results of validation to a save file for statistical purposes
6. Archive records (optional)
    move vendor files to Archive folder on the shared drive
7. Display session statistics
